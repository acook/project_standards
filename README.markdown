Project Standards
=================

This repository contains the default licensing and documentation shared by all
of my projects.

This repository is highly subject to changes as I attempt to nail down the
nuances of the legal and social implications of creating software, interacting
with communities, and being an entrepreneur in the 21st century.

If you have questions or concerns please contact me at the `github` email
address on my website anthonymcook.com.
