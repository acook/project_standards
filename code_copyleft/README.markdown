Copyleft Code Defaults
=============

The European Union Public License 1.2 (hereafter EUPL) will be the default license for projects which require copyleft protections. It provides strong non-viral copyleft attributes and closes the network service loophole while remaining compatible with most other open source licenses and development contexts. In fact it is so well suited that it is likely to replace the A2L as the general default.

### License Approval

The FSF, OSI, Debian, and Fedora organizations recognize the EUPL as a free and open source license.

### GPL Compatibility

The EUPL has explicit compatibility with the GPL to avoid any potential conflicts.

This compatibility doesn't remove any additional requirements imposed by the EUPL - in particular, its compatibility with the vanilla GPL doesn't provide a loophole out of adhering to the network service clause.
