Code of Conduct
===============

We all come together for a common goal of improving the Project and its Community. There is more to a project and its community than simple completion of assigned tasks, interacting with other members is often just as - or more - important.

There are incalculable combinations of ethnicity, belief system, culture, age, gender identity and expression, sexual preference and orientation, physical and mental ability, appearance, neuro(a)typicality, economic status, caste, social class, political affiliation, language familiarity, nation of origin or residence, and many other variables which must not be used to unfairly judge a person's worth or contributions.

Encouraged Behaviour
--------------------

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

Prohibited Behaviour
--------------------

* Any kind of online or offline sexual/physical/verbal/emotional threats, abuse, harassment, intimidation, discrimination, insults, spoofing, doxing, outing, stalking, or impersonating another member is strictly forbidden.
* Sockpuppeting, astroturfing, trolling, and flamebaiting the community is strictly forbidden.
* Hate speech, use of prejudicial epithets, calls to violence, abuse of power or status, encouragement of harm to others or self-harm, are all strictly forbidden. 

Community Spaces
----------------

Community Spaces include wikis, mailing lists, chat rooms, version control systems and their messages, issue tracking, conferences, meet ups, websites, and any other form of communication, gathering, or media managed, endorsed, or sponsored by the Project or Community.

Use of this Document
--------------------

It is an important part of every member's role to maintain self-awareness of their own behavior. Individuals who violate these guidelines, or whose ideology inherently conflicts with them, will be excluded from Community Spaces. A warning or discussion preceding such exclusion may be warranted, but is not required, and will be handled on a case-by-case basis.

If you witness any of the above in a Community Space, please contact the Community Standards Team immediately, but unless you are on the Community Standards Team, it is not your responsibility to police the words and actions of anyone else in the community.

Reporting violations of these guidelines will not be retaliated against and will be kept anonymous unless the reporter requests otherwise. However, misuse of these guidelines to bully members is not within the spirit of the guidelines and will be interpreted as harassment.

Questions and comments about this document should take place in the [Project Standards repository](https://codeberg.org/acook/project_standards) and not on individual project pages.
