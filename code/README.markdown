Code Defaults
=============

The Apache 2.0 License (hereafter A2L) will be the default license for projects. It provides clear boundaries while being highly compatible with most other open source licenses and use cases.

### License Approval

The FSF, OSI, Debian, and Fedora organizations recognize the A2L as a free and open source license.

### GPL Compatibility

The A2L is interoperable with the LGPL (any version) and with all GPLv3 variants.

The A2L is compatible with most open source licenses except for vanilla pre-3.0 GPL versions. Thankfully this is rarely an issue as most relevant libraries are LGPL or non-GPL. Likewise, GPL applications can link to A2L libraries without restriction. This "one-way" compatibility was fixed in the 4th draft of GPLv3.

Policies
--------

The LICENSE file can be copied unmodified into the root of new or existing source code repositories.

The NOTICE file should be modified as necessary to provide copyright and legal information.

A `README.markdown` file should also be included outlining the purpose of the product, project, or repository.
