# Getting Started

- A compiler/interpreter for the language you're using
- The latest project repo
- Sent me an email just to say hi and that you agree to the Contributor's Agreement (at the bottom)

# If You Want to Assist

- Check out the project's issues tab on Codeberg to see what there is to do
- Leave a comment on the issue you are working on
- Fork the repo and start getting familiar with the codebase
- Make your changes (see Git Commit Messages and Code Standards sections later in this document)
- Run the tests and examples to make sure you didn't break anything
- Open a Pull Request
- Also, feel free to email me (people do it all the time) or post a comment on the issue if you need help

# If You Have An Idea

- As above, check the list of issues on Codeberg
- See if there's an existing or similar idea
- If so, feel free to start working on a solution (see above section)
- If not, submit it as a new issue

# To Report a Bug

Please use Codeberg Issues and provide as much as possible of the following...

- The version or git SHA of the project that you're using
- An example to reproduce the problem
- A clear description of what you expected to happen
- Detailed information about what happened instead
- Include the full text of any error messages
- Your OS and its release info (eg Debian Jesse or Windows 8.1) and any other potentially relevant system info

# Git Commit Messages

- Write an informative commit message not about what you changed but *why*
- Keep the summary line short and to the point
- Keep commits small and don't squash commits
- Try to keep each commit in a working state whenever possible - or else mark them as WIP
- Use git add -p to chunk up your changes into logical units if you make several unrelated changes

# Code Standards

Please use idiomatic formatting for the programming language, there are plugins for many editors which do this automatically. Each project may specify additional formatting guidelines. 

- Use [EditorConfig](https://editorconfig.org/)
- Correct errors or new warnings that the CI and status checks report
